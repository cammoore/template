The Kipa Project was a part of the [Honolulu Annual Code Challenge 2016](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/).

Kipa's design takes into account the following issues in OCCC scheduling:

* OCCC detainees are allowed up to 12 visitors, and must provide staff with those names.

* Visitors must submit documentation to OCCC in order to be authorized to request visits.

* Once authorized, visitors and OCCC staff must agree upon a 30 minute time slot during the next seven days.
 
* Visitors must dress appropriately and bring additional documentation at the time of the visit.

* Unpredictable changes in staffing resources means that visits might be cancelled at the last minute.

*There are over 6,000 potential visitors, and the pool of visitors is constantly changing as detainees enter and exit OCCC.
